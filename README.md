Given access to the company's complete recordset of rides. This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

The project is to build a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:
•	Average Fare ($) Per City
•	Total Number of Rides Per City
•	Total Number of Drivers Per City
•	City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

Three pie charts:
•	% of Total Fares by City Type
•	% of Total Rides by City Type
•	% of Total Drivers by City Type

Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib


Pymaceuticals Inc

Pymaceuticals Inc., a burgeoning pharmaceutical company based out of San Diego, CA. Pymaceuticals specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've since begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. Given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. Your objective is to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.

Four plots are generated based on data analysis:
•	a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
•	a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
•	a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
•	a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
